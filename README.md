# Project Alpha — Venezuela Risk Surface (2015–Present)
**Quant-style open-source decision intelligence** modeling Venezuela as a multi-domain risk surface:  
(1) distressed sovereign credit / *debt-to-control optionality*, (2) regime non-stationarity, and (3) Caribbean “kinetic latency” decision-compression scenarios.

## Hiring Manager TL;DR
- **What I built:** a reproducible analysis package (report + figures + code) with explicit assumptions, sensitivity checks, and invalidation (“kill switch”) criteria.  
- **Why it matters:** converts a politicized topic into **decision-grade**, testable mechanisms tied to observable signals.  
- **Skills demonstrated:** Python analytics, scenario modeling, visualization, research ops (RFIs → evidence), technical writing, model risk discipline.

## Executive Summary
Most narratives treat Venezuela as a collapsed petrostate and external exposure as “bad loans.”  
This project tests a different framing: **distressed credit can behave like a control position** under certain constraints, and regional time-risk can create measurable commercial risk premia.

**This is open-source scenario analysis**. I do not claim access to classified data, and I do not assert contractual conversion rights without primary documentation.

## Key Questions (RFIs)
1) Is the China–Venezuela exposure best modeled as distressed credit **or** a debt-to-control mechanism?
2) Is there evidence of **regime change / non-stationarity** in repayment or production relationships?
3) Do “time-to-target” scenario bands imply **decision-compression** risk that could show up in logistics/insurance pricing?
4) What signals would **invalidate** each hypothesis?
